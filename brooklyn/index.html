<p>We saw <i>Brooklyn </i>last night. I got the DVD from Noreen who had borrowed it from Tom, whose husband had brought it from Singapore, so it was a black market copy. I’m okay with that. It’s the exception to the rule. The rule is Netflix. The rule used to be that Fred would buy DVDs from Amazon and we’d watch them once. We’re big series watchers.</p><p><i>Brooklyn</i><i></i>arrived with <i>The Danish Girl</i><i>, </i>which came from the same sidewalk table in Singapore. Tom said he<i></i>loved <i>Brooklyn</i><i>, </i>but didn’t really cotton to The <i>Danish Girl</i>. He sighed and said, “I get it. You’re a woman trapped in a man’s body. Fine. Whatever.” Noreen said she and Derek had really enjoyed <i>The Danish Girl</i><i></i>but thought <i>Brooklyn</i><i></i>was really slow. They were bored by it. So when Noreen and Derek dropped the DVDs in our mailbox last night as a special Valentine’s Day surprise, I was very happy. I don’t mind an interruption in our series watching. I’m not even sure if we’re in the middle of a series. I think Fred just mentioned that the fourth season of <i>Homeland</i><i></i>had just come out. (My only remark on that was that Claire Danes had probably needed a few months’ rest to get the angsty look off her face for a while. She always looks so stressed in that show. It’s always a relief when it’s over. Loved her in <i>Shopgirl</i>, by the way.)</p><p>The title of <i>Brooklyn </i>made me think that it was probably some kind of gang-related, modern-day shoot-em-up movie. I didn’t want to see that. However, it is actually about a young Irish girl in the Fifties (?) who moves to Brooklyn from Ireland. It’s about the immigrant experience. It’s about a girl leaving everything and everyone behind and heading out to a new country where she knows no one and has to make a new life. And, as I told Fred (with tears in my eyes), I’ve done that twice. I was that girl. In fact, one of those times I actually moved to Brooklyn (from Texas in the Early Nineties, but it was a big, fat, hair deal. I was greener than I knew.)</p><p>I won’t go into spoilers. There aren’t really any spoilers. It’s just her journey. She makes the move and has some struggles. And just when I was ready for it to, the movie comes to a clean little end. Okay. I’ll tell you. There’s an alien invasion. She ends up finding a stockpile of machine guns on the ship and leading a revolt, saving the day. Now you know. (PS. Not really.)</p><p>When it was over, I pondered why Tom had enjoyed it and Noreen had not. Tom is Irish-American and Noreen is Irish. I posit that maybe it was the immigrant experience that hit a note with Tom. Also, he’s an American living here. Maybe that whole idea of leaving everything and everyone you know (he’s also Catholic and has a decent sized family back in the US) and moving to a new country touched a nerve. Noreen admitted that it should have hit a nerve with her, as generations of her father’s family got on boats and moved to the US, never to return to the Land of Ire, but it just didn’t. Also, Noreen is an immigrant to the Netherlands, as she hails from Ireland. However, she did arrive on our shores with a husband, two dogs and a job, so it wasn’t the same. </p><p>Brooklyn is a lovely film. The sets are real; the story skips along at a nice pace. The girl’s transformation is convincing, and the secondary and tertiary characters are good. Noreen told me that it even won a BAFTA award. </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27"></a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
