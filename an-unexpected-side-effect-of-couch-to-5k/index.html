<p>Yesterday was a surprisingly busy day. I got up at 7:15 and was sitting in front of my computer perusing my email at 8:00 when I read an email sent the night before that gave the time and address of where I was supposed to be at 10:00. The story of that day can be found here: xxx</p><p>Because of this surprise appointment (which was to go to four o’clock but actually went until six), I didn’t get home until 6:45, and I had to leave for choir just before seven. I’d originally planned to run mid-morning.Thus, I did not get to run yesterday, which was disappointing. </p><p>In fact, my first thought when I saw that I had two hours to be somewhere was to think, <i>If I go right this second, I could get back in time to do my run and then my pushups and still be on time.</i> Of course that would have precluded eating a decent breakfast, taking time to be sure I had everything I needed for the day and giving myself plenty of time to get there. Hence, I said, “Well, I’ll get out at four and I can run right when I get home and have time to get to choir on time.” </p><p>Then the day ran late. They sent the women home and most of the men stayed to almost six o'clock.</p><p>Then, on the way to choir, the chain on my bike quit working. I’m not sure if it broke or just got off track, but it wasn’t pedaling, so I dropped it off in front of the bike shop and caught the tram. I arrived at the church a few minutes late.</p><p>After choir, I walked to the tram stop, which is sort of not there at the moment because of some construction, and the tram whizzed by. I decided to walk home. And I enjoyed the walk. Fred regularly asks me if I would like to walk to (and then from) the Center to do some shopping or see a movie. As a good husband, I am always ready to negotiate. I agree to walk one way, but I do it out of obligation, not because I think it would be enjoyable to walk to or from the Center.</p><p>The evening was clear and dry, and there weren’t that many people on the streets. I enjoyed walking along the canals and then by the houses closer to home. Then when I got here, I took off my watch, which counts my steps, and I saw that I had managed to walk over 10,000 steps on a day that was a lot of sitting around – at the voiceover job and in choir. </p><p>Then this morning, I got up and walked back and forth to the bike shop, which normally feels like a bother. This time I actually enjoyed it, even though I got sleeted on going to the shop. I decided which streets were the most interesting and what I wanted to see. I listened to a podcast along the way. I actually enjoyed being outside, feeling my body work. My legs feel strong. I enjoyed breathing. It was a productive and fun half hour-ish.</p><p>I had not expected that to happen. I’m normally pretty sedentary. I will normally stay in on a beautiful day with absolutely no problems or regrets with missing the good weather – unlike my husband.</p><p>My newly trim sister, Kathy, went indoor rock climbing the other day. I found myself thinking, Hmm. That sounds fun. AND I would actually have the energy and strength to do it now. Maybe running is a gateway drug. Maybe I’ll start enjoying all sorts of physical activities, or at least looking for opportunities to do outdoor activities – like indoor rock climbing? Suddenly a hike through the woods doesn’t sound horrible. </p><p>By the way, the pushups progress is interesting. If I stay on schedule, and I probably will, I will be at 100 pushups by the end of March – for the record, they are done in five blocks of 20 with a 90 second break in between. I’ll also be running for 35 minutes at a stretch by mid-March. Now I’m looking at my stomach and wondering what kind of abdominal regimen I’m going to find. I’ve been avoiding the abs. I don’t really have a problem with that area, but I can see tightening them up. I’m 50. My body has changed. I wouldn’t mind seeing what I could do with what’s there.</p><p>So that’s what happened. I seem to be going down the slippery slope of good health. I’m ready to see where this path leads me. By the way, I’ll do yesterday’s run today so I’ll stay on track. Progress, not perfection.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">B - An Unexpected Side Effect of Couch to 5K</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
