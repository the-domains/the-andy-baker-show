<h1>A - We Don’t Do Valentine’s Day</h1><p>Fred is not a fan of ‘imported American holidays’. I think that’s a term that I came up with. I can’t imagine him actually saying that, although I’ve attributed the sentiment to him for years. This goes for Halloween as well as Valentine’s Day.</p><p>His argument regarding Valentine’s Day is that his youngest sister and her husband were married on 14 February about 40 years ago, but they were not married on Valentine’s Day. Valentine’s Day arrived in the Netherlands years later. And Fred is not having it.</p><p>What happens is that I always go out and buy expensive chocolate and give it to him, expecting (and receiving) nothing in return. That’s not a problem. I get the chocolate I like and we enjoy it together. It’s just part of the deal. </p><p>This afternoon, Fred said, “I’m going out to get flowers.” He returned with a bunch of red tulips and put them in a vase on the table. I know how he is when the flowers are actually for me. These are not flowers for me. They are flowers because he wanted tulips on the table. </p><p>When I was growing up, Valentine’s Day was a big deal. It was always a part of school. We got white paper bags and decorated them. We bought packages of valentines and put them in the bags. There was the ceremonial emptying of the bags on the day. There is a tremendous amount of marketing and lots of things to buy. It’s something that is woven into the fabric of society. It was originally a religious holiday (St. Valentine’s Day), but it has become pretty much a non-denominational day of love. That said, I just Googled it and see a number of articles on why Muslims can’t celebrate Valentine’s Day. </p><p>They do Valentine’s Day here, but it’s not done well, and it’s mostly done by younger folks. There is some marketing of Valentine’s Day merchandise, but it’s not a big thing. It’s the same with Halloween. There’s some parties and decorations, but I always look at everything and think, “Amateurs.” There’s something about having a holiday shoved down your throat once a year every year of your life. It’s about everyone being aware of the details. Everyone has a shared history. Everyone has heard the same stories (St. Valentine in prison making a valentine on a leaf and Halloween actually being the Devil’s birthday). There’s the whining about being alone on Valentine’s Day and warnings about razor blades in apples.</p><p>I feel the same about Sinterklaas (5 December). Dutch people go crazy over it. There are decorations and traditions. There are stories of Sinterklaas from years past. I understand it, but I have no connection with it. It’s all above the neck. There is no heart or emotion involved. I just get through it. I will say that I do a much better job participating in Sinterklaas than Fred does participating in Valentine’s Day, but I just walk through it, waiting for it to end. I don’t actually enjoy it. And why? Not because of the controversy that surrounds it and the discussion of the implied (or overt) racism that has become an annual event in itself. I remain firmly agnostic regarding that argument. Every time it comes up, I just sit and wait for it to pass, like waiting for a bad smell to disperse. I know it will be over soon.</p><p>My point is that people here love Sinterklaas and I do not. Why do they love it? It is woven into society. It is part of their past. Everyone has a stockpile of memories they love to sort through. I do not.</p><p>So we don’t celebrate Valentine’s Day in our house. Fred shows me he loves me regularly, in any number of ways. I’m not bothered by not getting something special one day of the year. And if I want chocolate, I’ll buy it myself.</p><p>Or maybe he’s secretly Muslim. </p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-local " data-reactid="20"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="21"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="22"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="23"><span data-reactid="24"><!-- react-empty: 25 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="26"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="27">A - We Don’t Do Valentine’s Day</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="28"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="29"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="30"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
