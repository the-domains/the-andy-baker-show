            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>We Don’t Do Valentine’s Day</h1><p>Fred is not a fan of ‘imported American holidays’. I think that’s a term that I came up with. I can’t imagine him actually saying that, although I’ve attributed the sentiment to him for years. This goes for Halloween as well as Valentine’s Day.</p></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<p>We saw Brooklyn last night. I got the DVD from Noreen who had borrowed it from Tom, whose husband had brought it from Singapore, so it was a black market copy. I’m okay with that. It’s the exception to the rule. The rule is Netflix. The rule used to be that Fred would buy DVDs from Amazon and we’d watch them once. We’re big series watchers.</p>]]></description>

Side Effect of Couch to 5K]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An Unexpected
Side Effect of Couch to 5K</h1><p>Yesterday
was a surprisingly busy day. I got up at 7:15 and was sitting in front of my
computer perusing my email at 8:00 when I read an email sent the night before
that gave the time and address of where I was supposed to be at 10:00. The
story of that day can be found here: xxx</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2ee4d7ca131d827315804630c57d761bcffdc6c7.png"></article>]]></description>

            <title><![CDATA[I’ve Begun to Run]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I’ve Begun to Run</h1><p>Towards
the end of the last part of 2015, I read an article in the Huffington Post
about the benefits of running. I don’t even think it was specifically about the
benefits of running for ‘older’ people. I think it was the
article about the benefits of running that don’t have to do with losing weight ,
which is not one of my (several) issues.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/20a8904277d1c6f92d1c734bdbb1bd1b4f0019aa.jpg"></article>]]></description>
