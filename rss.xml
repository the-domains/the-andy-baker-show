Side Effect of Couch to 5K]]></title>
            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>An Unexpected
Side Effect of Couch to 5K</h1><p>Yesterday
was a surprisingly busy day. I got up at 7:15 and was sitting in front of my
computer perusing my email at 8:00 when I read an email sent the night before
that gave the time and address of where I was supposed to be at 10:00. The
story of that day can be found here: xxx</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/2ee4d7ca131d827315804630c57d761bcffdc6c7.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>I’ve Begun to Run</h1><p>Towards
the end of the last part of 2015, I read an article in the Huffington Post
about the benefits of running. I don’t even think it was specifically about the
benefits of running for ‘older’ people. I think it was the
article about the benefits of running that don’t have to do with losing weight ,
which is not one of my (several) issues.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/20a8904277d1c6f92d1c734bdbb1bd1b4f0019aa.jpg"></article>]]></description>
