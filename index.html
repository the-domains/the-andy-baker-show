(Something had happened and I had a sometimes-painful knot in my left calf, so I made an appointment to see the doctor. He referred me to a lovely physical therapist down the block.) </p></div><div class="Paragraph color-text t-a-j" data-reactid="87"><p data-reactid="88">When I tried to download the app to my phone, it told me that I needed a new phone. My phone (an iPhone 4s) was too old for the app. I researched it and got a new phone. That took a little doing. The calf pain was cured after two treatments of &#x27;dry needling,&#x27; which looks similar to, but is not, acupuncture. I bought the shoes at Asis, which was suggested by Noreen. They look at how you run and suggest the right shoes for you. </p></div></div></div></section><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-large color-title text-align-center d-b p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="89"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="90"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 color-title m-a" data-reactid="91"><div class="System-font m-a Headline" data-reactid="92"><h1 data-reactid="93"><span class="" data-reactid="94"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="95">B - An Unexpected Side Effect of Couch to 5K</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 96 --></div><!-- react-empty: 97 --><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 color-text ls-t-a-j col-2 col-gap-s m-a" data-reactid="98"><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="99"><p data-reactid="100">Yesterday was a surprisingly busy day.

I got the DVD from Noreen who had borrowed it from Tom, whose husband had brought it from Singapore, so it was a black market copy. I’m okay with that. It’s the exception to the rule. The rule is Netflix. The rule used to be that Fred would buy DVDs from Amazon and we’d watch them once. We’re big series watchers.</p></div><div class="Paragraph" data-reactid="112"><p data-reactid="113">Brooklynarrived with The Danish Girl, which came from the same sidewalk table in Singapore. Tom said heloved Brooklyn, but didn’t really cotton to The Danish Girl. He sighed and said, “I get it. You’re a woman trapped in a man’s body. Fine. Whatever.” Noreen said she and Derek had really enjoyed The Danish Girlbut thought Brooklynwas really slow. They were bored by it. So when Noreen and Derek dropped the DVDs in our mailbox last night as a special Valentine’s Day surprise, I was very happy. I don’t mind an interruption in our series watching. I’m not even sure if we’re in the middle of a series. I think Fred just mentioned that the fourth season of Homelandhad just come out. (My only remark on that was that Claire Danes had probably needed a few months’ rest to get the angsty look off her face for a while. She always looks so stressed in that show. It’s always a relief when it’s over. Loved her in Shopgirl, by the way.)</p></div></div></div></section><section id="9" class="Section Section--components-1 d-f a-i-stretch no-padding title-size-large color-title section-bgcover-w ls-min-h-80vh  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="114"><div class="Component p-1 ls-p-8 d-f fx-r pos-r w-100p  a-i-start t-a-l" data-reactid="115"><div class="Bg op-30" data-reactid="116"><div class="Cover ov-h" data-reactid="117"><picture class="min-h-80px" data-reactid="118"><source media="(min-width: 1440px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e2a2bb70bd9bbd9b145b85d287dc76fd/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3e1fad55-64d7-4a72-bf15-eaa4ff5c3b5d.jpg&amp;width=696" style="object-position:50.57471264367817% 44.44444444444444%;" data-reactid="119"/><source media="(min-width: 1280px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e2a2bb70bd9bbd9b145b85d287dc76fd/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3e1fad55-64d7-4a72-bf15-eaa4ff5c3b5d.jpg&amp;width=696" style="object-position:50.57471264367817% 44.44444444444444%;" data-reactid="120"/><source media="(min-width: 720px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e2a2bb70bd9bbd9b145b85d287dc76fd/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3e1fad55-64d7-4a72-bf15-eaa4ff5c3b5d.jpg&amp;width=696" style="object-position:50.57471264367817% 44.44444444444444%;" data-reactid="121"/><source media="(min-width: 360px)" srcset="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/ddccda130f814d3d5f8e514389f6a470/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3e1fad55-64d7-4a72-bf15-eaa4ff5c3b5d.jpg&amp;width=360" style="object-position:50.57471264367817% 44.44444444444444%;" data-reactid="122"/><img class="color-loading" data-width="696" data-height="972" data-ratio="0.7160493827160493" src="https://imgflo.herokuapp.com/graph/vahj1ThiexotieMo/e2a2bb70bd9bbd9b145b85d287dc76fd/passthrough.jpg?input=https%3A%2F%2Fthe-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F3e1fad55-64d7-4a72-bf15-eaa4ff5c3b5d.jpg&amp;width=696" style="object-position:50.57471264367817% 44.44444444444444%;" data-reactid="123"/></picture></div></div><div class="color-box w-100p op-90 ls-fx-r ls-p-5 bx-sh-soft" data-reactid="124"><div class="Group Group--heading min-w-240px p-1 ls-p-2 fx-b-50p color-title h-100p" data-reactid="125"><!-- react-empty: 126 --><div class="System-font  Headline" data-reactid="127"><h1 data-reactid="128"><span class="" data-reactid="129"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="130">A - People Around Us</a></span></h1></div><!-- react-empty: 131 --></div><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px p-1 ls-p-2 fx-b-50p color-title h-100p" data-reactid="132"><!-- react-empty: 133 --><div class="Paragraph color-text" data-reactid="134"><p data-reactid="135">Our building has fourteen apartments. There are five floors and each floor has three apartments, except the top floor, which has a terrace in place of the third apartment. Nine of the apartments have balconies. All of the residents in the one line have to share the terrace. They don’t actually do that. Once in a while (in good weather, so do the math), someone will have dinner out there, but it actually goes unused most of the time. It’s mostly used by our neighbor, Pita, who only has to walk across the hall to use it.

There are five floors and each floor has three apartments, except the top floor, which has a terrace in place of the third apartment. Nine of the apartments have balconies. All of the residents in the one line have to share the terrace. They don’t actually do that. Once in a while (in good weather, so do the math), someone will have dinner out there, but it actually goes unused most of the time. It’s mostly used by our neighbor, Pita, who only has to walk across the hall to use it.
