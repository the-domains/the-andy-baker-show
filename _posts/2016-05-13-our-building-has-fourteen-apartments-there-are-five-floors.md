# People Around Us

Our building has fourteen apartments. There are five floors and each floor has three apartments, except the top floor, which has a terrace in place of the third apartment. Nine of the apartments have balconies. All of the residents in the one line have to share the terrace. They don't actually do that. Once in a while (in good weather, so do the math), someone will have dinner out there, but it actually goes unused most of the time. It's mostly used by our neighbor, Pita, who only has to walk across the hall to use it. It's right outside our back door, across from our balcony, through a thin hedge of bamboo that Pita planted years ago.

As I relocated here from New York, I'm used to living in a building with strangers and not really knowing any of them. Here are the names of the people I know in the building: Pita. However, there's also The Priest (a retired priest), The Posh Couple (a hetero couple who are about ten years older than us), The Downstairs Neighbors, The Couple on the First Floor, The Man with Parkinson's and His Wife, The Indonesian Woman, and I think there's an Asian Couple. I also know that there is a family with three kids. They're Latino or something like that. They are probably renters. Also, it should be noted that The Indonesian 

_Man_

just died. We knew him for years, spoke to him regularly (about the building and how things were going) and only recently learned his name after getting the death announcement that was slipped into our mailbox one day. Also, The Germans just moved out, as Fred told me last night while we were doing dishes. "Really?" I asked. "I just saw them the other day." I looked out the window. The apartment is empty. I think that's also a rental unit.

This building, like my building in New York, is a community, but it's very loose. The Indonesian Man's sister was a presence for years, as she was really decrepit, had Coke bottle-lensed glasses and always seemed surprised when I walked past her. When she became bed ridden and then died, it was barely mentioned. The Germans arrived one day and then left a couple of years later. No fanfare either time. No one comes around and introduces themselves. 

We only knew our neighbor downstairs, Martin (the predecessors to The Downstairs Neighbors), because he invited us down one day to talk about all the noise we were making in our apartment with the vacuuming and the walking and the living. While Fred said he would carry, rather than drag, the vacuum, I said that I wouldn't. I vacuum for 15 minutes a week, usually late on a Saturday or Sunday morning. He actually came up on a Saturday night while we were having a dinner party to tell us that we were making too much noise. He was going through a breakup. His girlfriend had just moved out. He was in a bad mood. Fortunately, he met someone new and then complaints stopped. Then they had a baby. Then they had a dinner party and a couple said, "Well, if you ever think of selling, just tell us. We'll take it." A deal was made and Martin, his wife and their child were out of the apartment amazingly fast. 

The Downstairs Neighbors are fine. We have very little contact with them. I went down the other day to retrieve a package that they'd signed for. That's about it. Fred goes to the same gym as the man in couple. They seem fine. Fred pointed to a picture in a magazine the other day, "He looks like the guy downstairs," Fred said. 

"Yeah," I replied. "Except the guy downstairs has RAF, Resting Asshole Face." That's the male equivalent to resting bitch face. He always looks angry, like he's just been insulted or found out that someone dented the door of his expensive car. It's a pity. He's fairly handsome when he smiles. We saw them in a neighborhood bookstore the other day with their new baby. They were friendly. Can't imagine waking up next to that every day.

I'm totally fine with our relationship with our neighbors. It might be nice to have one of those TV sitcom relationships, but it never happens. Even when we had a gay couple as neighbors it didn't happen. But the one was an older Dutch Jewish guy and the other was a younger (though not young) Latino who had palsy or something on the one side of his body. Nice enough guys, but no real click.

The anonymity of a city has always appealed to me. That whole everyone knowing your business thing that happens in small towns and suburbs creeps me out a bit. We all know certain things about each other, but we don't get close at all. We never socialize. What we do is know who lives here. We see each other come and go occasionally. There's a familiarity and that's enough.
