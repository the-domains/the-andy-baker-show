# Simple Green Smoothies

One of my favorite podcasts of late is Entrepreneur on Fire, or E-O-Fire for short. The basic idea is a guy (John Lee Dumas) interviewing entrepreneurs. Every day he speaks with someone about their entrepreneurial journey. Some are years into it. Some have just begun. It is a seven-day-a-week show.

It is through EOFire that I have learned about free webinars, helpful books, Snap chat **and **Super Green Smoothies.

It is no secret that the basic recipe for a Simple Green Smoothie is kale or spinach made into a slurry (my word, not theirs) with fruit thrown in. You can also use vegetables, as well as chai seeds or flax seeds. Their basic batch makes two servings. On the weekend, I like to make a double batch and share it with Fred. During the week, I make a batch, drink half and put the other half into the fridge for the next day.

I have to say that I love my smoothies. I love that I'm getting a daily does of fresh fruit and vegetables. There is apparently a myriad of vitamins and minerals in a smoothie. And the whole argument about not juicing fruit (because when you take out all of the fiber it's mostly just sugar) is not an issue because all of the fiber is in the smoothie. And what a nice dose of fiber it is!

I'm currently smack dab in the middle of a 30-day smoothie challenge. I think the point of it is to get smoothies folded into your day over the course of a month, which, as any pop psychology nerd can tell you is plenty of time to build a new habit. (Enter a link to an article that states that it takes 21 days to form a new habit.) I will admit that I haven't gone through every recipe. I'm sort of using the same recipe over and over, which is fine because it's good. I've ventured out to different recipes, but I'm big on the repeat and blending up what I know and what I have.

Here's one little experiment I did that is worth mentioning. We had a half bag of salad that was right at the point of going off, but it was still good. I threw some kale into the blender and then thought, "Why not?" And I threw the salad in. Maybe not such a great choice. Kale has a definite taste, as does spinach, but it's sort of innocuous and hidden with the fruit. Some of the salad greens really stood out. They poked their little heads out from the smells and tastes of the fruit and my mouth and nose were like, "Uh...what are you doing here? Were you invited?" I probably won't do it again.

So I'm loving the smoothies. It feels very healthy and it's a good way to bring all those trace minerals and stuff into my new, healthy life style.
