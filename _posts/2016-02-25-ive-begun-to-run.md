# I've Begun to Run
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/ac77ae4d-62b8-4f96-b3ae-95e1239814ec.jpg)

Towards the end of the last part of 2015, I read an article in the [Huffington Post][0] about the benefits of running. I don't even think it was specifically about the benefits of running for 'older' people. I think it was [the article about the benefits of running that don't have to do with losing weight ][1], which is not one of my (several) issues.

My plan was to buy shoes, get the [Couch to 5K][2] app on my phone, have the pain in my calf looked at, and buy shoes. (Something had happened and I had a sometimes-painful knot in my left calf, so I made an appointment to see the doctor. He referred me to a lovely physical therapist down the block.) 

When I tried to download the app to my phone, it told me that I needed a new phone. My phone (an iPhone 4s) was too old for the app. I researched it and got a new phone. That took a little doing. The calf pain was cured after two treatments of 'dry needling,' which looks similar to, but is not, acupuncture. I bought the shoes at Asis, which was suggested by Noreen. They look at how you run and suggest the right shoes for you. 

That all took a while, but I didn't mind because I didn't want to start running on 1 January because I didn't want to be one of 'those people', the people who start a new thing on 1 January and then stop because, "Yeah. I got really busy. But I'm planning on getting back to it when things calm down." I decided that I would start after the year had really begun. It happened that my start day fell on the very random Friday 23 January. 

As is my style, I did not announce the start of my running on social media. I do not post updates or even the little badges they provide. I don't feel like I need that encouragement. I also don't need people knowing that I stopped, if I should, which I don't think I will.

Running is not something I've ever wanted to do. It's something I've actually avoided. I've always said (and it's embarrassing how unoriginal these lines are) that I only run for the bus or that I would only run if I were being chased. My sister, Kathy, started running as a part of her weight loss regimen. Even then I thought, _No thank you_. However, hearing that it would help me sleep better and that it might actually combat some of the signs of aging (I'm thinking specifically about my knees), I decided it was worth a try. I'm enjoying it.

The Couch to 5K program starts you off really slowly, like painfully slow. It's a minute run and a minute walk eight times bookended by five-minute warm up/ cool down walks. I am now in week four and am running four minutes at a stretch, which (pardon the pun) is a stretch. I hear myself thinking, "Just keep going. It couldn't be that much longer." There's actually a recorded voice that says things like, "Hey awesome runner! Great choice to run today!" and "Keep going, runner! You're doing a great job!" That last one comes towards the end when I need to hear it. Yesterday, I looked at the phone to see how much time was left when she says that. Ninety seconds.

I've coupled this Couch to 5K regimen with the pushups app. I used to do 50 every night before bed. That was high school, when I was in band and it was just a way to try to assist my body in morphing from boy to man. Not sure it helped, but I liked being able to do 50 pushups. It surprised people. It's been a while since I did pushups regularly.

This time around, I YouTubed how to do a proper pushup. Elbows in or out? Which did I want? Apparently one is better for chest and in is better for triceps. Who knew? (Not me.) I go with out and I pay attention to form. Same with running. I go slow and pay attention to form. I'm amazed at how much of our neighborhood I'm able to see. I've seen parts that I would never have seen if I weren't looking for a street to run down and circle back on.

So thumbs up on the running. I enjoy having done it. Someone asked the other day if I had hit the point yet where I got the endorphin rush. I think that comes later. At this point I'm just making it through my run. No endorphins, but I'm sweating, which is new. And I sleep better. I like that.
