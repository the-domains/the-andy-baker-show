# An Unexpected
Side Effect of Couch to 5K

Yesterday
was a surprisingly busy day. I got up at 7:15 and was sitting in front of my
computer perusing my email at 8:00 when I read an email sent the night before
that gave the time and address of where I was supposed to be at 10:00\. The
story of that day can be found here: xxx

Because
of this surprise appointment (which was to go to four o'clock but actually went
until six), I didn't get home until 6:45, and I had to leave for choir just
before seven. I'd originally planned to run mid-morning.Thus, I did not get to run yesterday, which was disappointing. 

In
fact, my first thought when I saw that I had two hours to be somewhere was to
think, _If I go right this second, I could get back in time to do my run and
then my pushups and still be on time._ Of course that would have precluded eating a
decent breakfast, taking time to be sure I had everything I needed for the day
and giving myself plenty of time to get there. Hence, I said, "Well, I'll get
out at four and I can run right when I get home and have time to get to choir
on time." 

Then
the day ran late. They sent the women home and most of the men stayed to almost six o'clock.

Then, on
the way to choir, the chain on my bike quit working. I'm not sure if it broke
or just got off track, but it wasn't pedaling, so I dropped it off in front of
the bike shop and caught the tram. I arrived at the church a few minutes late.

After
choir, I walked to the tram stop, which is sort of not there at the moment because of some construction, and
the tram whizzed by. I decided to walk home. And I enjoyed the walk. Fred
regularly asks me if I would like to walk to (and then from) the Center to do some shopping or
see a movie. As a good husband, I am always ready to negotiate. I agree to walk
one way, but I do it out of obligation, not because I think it would be
enjoyable to walk to or from the Center.

The evening was clear and dry, and there weren't that many people on the streets. I
enjoyed walking along the canals and then by the houses closer to home. Then when
I got here, I took off my watch, which counts my steps, and I saw that I had
managed to walk over 10,000 steps on a day that was a lot of sitting around --
at the voiceover job and in choir. 

Then
this morning, I got up and walked back and forth to the bike shop, which
normally feels like a bother. This time I actually enjoyed it, even though I
got sleeted on going to the shop. I decided which streets were the most
interesting and what I wanted to see. I listened to a podcast along the way. I
actually enjoyed being outside, feeling my body work. My legs feel strong. I
enjoyed breathing. It was a productive and fun half hour-ish.

I
had not expected that to happen. I'm normally pretty sedentary. I will normally stay in
on a beautiful day with absolutely no problems or regrets with missing the good
weather -- unlike my husband.

My
newly trim sister, Kathy, went indoor rock climbing the other day. I found
myself thinking, Hmm. That sounds fun. AND I would actually have the energy and
strength to do it now. Maybe running is a gateway drug. Maybe I'll start
enjoying all sorts of physical activities, or at least looking for
opportunities to do outdoor activities -- like indoor rock climbing? Suddenly a
hike through the woods doesn't sound horrible. 

By
the way, the pushups progress is interesting. If I stay on schedule, and I
probably will, I will be at 100 pushups by the end of March -- for the record,
they are done in five blocks of 20 with a 90 second break in between. I'll also
be running for 35 minutes at a stretch by mid-March. Now I'm looking at my
stomach and wondering what kind of abdominal regimen I'm going to find. I've
been avoiding the abs. I don't really have a problem with that area, but I can
see tightening them up. I'm 50\. My body has changed. I wouldn't mind seeing
what I could do with what's there.

So
that's what happened. I seem to be going down the slippery slope of good
health. I'm ready to see where this path leads me. By the way, I'll do
yesterday's run today so I'll stay on track. Progress, not perfection.
